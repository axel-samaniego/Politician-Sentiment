# Tweet-Sentiment

### Currently done: Categorized Politician Tweets as having Positive or Negative Sentiment
#### Libraries Used In Data Collection
- python-twitter (imported as "twitter")
- pandas
#### Libraries Used in Model Building and Evaluation
- re
- string
- numpy
- pandas
- nltk
- scikit-learn
#### Model was trained on Kaggle dataset with 1.6 million labeled tweets
#### Tasks Going Forward: 
- Set up Twitter API to be able to take tweets in real time, potentially from a user's own timeline as well
- Fix model since the results on politicians' tweets don't quite match with expectations. I believe some words get lost in hashtags and slang.

### Final Project Goals: Be able to take in tweets in real-time and categorize as positive or negative
